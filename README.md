# Music Streaming Android Application
 Created a music streaming android application using google firebase for real-time database and real-time storage. 
Worked on it as my Major project and learnt lot of new things while working on it.

Used Dexter library which is a library that simplifies the process of requesting permissions at runtime.
Android Marshmallow includes a new functionality to let users grant or deny permissions when running an app instead of granting them all when installing it. This approach gives the user more control over applications but requires developers to add lots of code to support it.

Dexter frees your permission code from your activities and lets you write that logic anywhere you want.

Also Used Google firebase for the real-time database and real-time storage so as to keep the database updated with all the recent songs.
